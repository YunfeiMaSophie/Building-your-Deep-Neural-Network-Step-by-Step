# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step
Welcome to your week 4 assignment (part 1 of 2)! You have previously trained a 2-layer Neural Network (with a single hidden layer). This week, you will build a deep neural network, with as many layers as you want!  - In this notebook, you will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network. - In the next assignment, you will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.  **After this assignment you will be able to:** - Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model - Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer) - Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
