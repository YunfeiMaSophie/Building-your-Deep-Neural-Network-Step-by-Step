# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step
A deep neural network with customized layers as you want.

Will ues the functions implemented here build a deep neural network for image classification.

- Used non-linear units like ReLU to improve models
- Built a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implemented an easy-to-use neural network class
